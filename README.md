# Open Hadist Search

Just getting tired of searching Hadist in the wild...

I'll just make my own..

This is a hadist search webapp.

- You can publicly publish the app via github
- It will publish using a custom domain name, so you should have one prepared
- You can modify the source, to use your own, as long as it has the same directory structure with the default


## Steps to build

Assuming this is your repo:

1. prepare a domain name for github page
2. prepare Google CSE
2. Modify `.env` to your liking
3. `yarn && yarn build`

## NOTES

- the build command works on Mac, probably also work on bash (i haven't check)
- pull requests are welcome for modifications that benefits all
- a fork is recommended for those who want to modify the source for personal/organizational needs: like adding a brand, or using your own domain
